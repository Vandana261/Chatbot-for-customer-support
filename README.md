## Chatbot for Customer Support

The Customer Support Chatbot is designed to facilitate natural language conversations with users, leveraging Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model capable of generating human-like responses. This project integrates DialoGPT with Flask, a Python web framework, to create a web application for interacting with users through a chat interface.

## Technologies Used:
1. Microsoft DialoGPT: Utilized for generating conversational responses.
2. Flask: Employed as the backend web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used for the frontend development to create an interactive and visually appealing chat interface.
4. jQuery: Implemented to handle HTTP requests between the frontend and backend components.

## Usage:
Once the application is running, users can initiate conversations by typing messages into the chat interface. The chatbot will generate responses based on the input provided by the user. Users can engage in natural language conversations and receive helpful responses from the chatbot.

In addition to the Python code and web interface, the project includes a intents.json file where you can store additional information or configuration settings for the chatbot. You can modify this file as needed to customize the behavior of the chatbot or to store persistent data.

## Training the Chatbot:
To improve the accuracy of the chatbot's responses, you can fine-tune the DialoGPT model by providing it with additional training data. Refer to the documentation provided by Microsoft for guidance on training and fine-tuning DialoGPT.
